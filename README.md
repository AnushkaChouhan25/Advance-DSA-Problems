# Advanced DSA Topics Challenge

## Overview

Welcome to my Advanced DSA Topics Challenge repository! This repository is dedicated to solving and sharing solutions for advanced Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems. Over the course of 30 days, I am diving deep into complex topics such as Trees, Binary Search Trees (BST), Graphs, Dynamic Programming (DP), Heaps, and Tries.

## Challenge Plan

- **Duration:** 30 days
- **Focus Areas:** Trees, BST, Graphs, DP, Heaps, Tries
- **Daily Goals:** Solve multiple problems related to the focus areas, understand their concepts, and share solutions.

## Problems and Solutions

Each day, I'll be tackling a set of problems, sharing solutions, and providing dry runs (debugs) where necessary. Here are some example problems from the challenge:

1. **Insert into a Binary Search Tree**
2. **Kth Smallest Element in a BST**
3. **Validate Binary Search Tree**
4. **Vertical Width of a Binary Tree**
5. **Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree**
6. **Inorder Successor/Predecessor in BST**

For the complete list of problems and solutions, check out the respective directories in this repository.

## Contributing
